/**
 * Delete the shopper's Changuito data for the wallet in the session cookie.
 *
 * What goes:
 *   - the encrypted Día profile (email, password, DNI, postal code)
 *   - archived chats, and the order rows that hang off them
 *   - order rows stored under this address even if the chat id differs
 *   - checkout records in `kv` (`checkout:<orderId>`, buyer on the document)
 *   - the working turn of each archived chat (`changuito:turn:<sessionId>`)
 *   - the hourly usage counter (`changuito:user-turns:<address>`)
 *   - a legacy card-owner row, if one still names this address
 *
 * What does not go, and the profile screen says so: the shopper's account at
 * Día, and anything already written on Solana. A turn that was still only in
 * `kv` and not yet archived expires on its own within the hour; its key is the
 * session id, which this table does not index by wallet.
 *
 * The counter key is the same string login-gate.ts builds. It is copied here
 * rather than exported from that module, which is shared with the other chain
 * repo. lib/test/account-delete.test.ts reads both files so they cannot drift.
