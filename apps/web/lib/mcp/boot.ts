/**
 * A real MCP client and a real MCP server, in one process, talking over a
 * linked pair of in-memory transports.
 *
 * The alternative — importing the tool functions and calling them directly —
 * would be shorter and would be a lie: the point of this app is to show what
 * the MCP server does, so the protocol has to actually be on the wire, even
 * when the wire is a pair of queues. `tools/list` and `tools/call` are the
 * same round trips Claude Desktop makes.
 *
 * Spawning the published binary as a subprocess would also be real MCP, but
 * the binary registers the checkout tools, which drive a headed browser on the
 * server host. That cannot run on Vercel. `@changuito/mcp/server` is the half
 * that can: it has no path to the checkout module at all.
